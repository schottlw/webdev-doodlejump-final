## Self-Evaluation:
100/100

For the amount of time we had, we worked hard and created a neat, functioning game that satisfies the rubric requirements

## Self-Reflection:
We've all become decently experienced in javaScript development with phaser, Fetch API, web APIs etc. throughout the course of this semester, so we were all able to successfully code most of the project. Like any project, we ran in to a few roadblocks, but we were ultimatley able to solve issues we had with research and problem solving.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Several hours throughout the week
